This app is meant to bridge the gap between students with learning disabilities and their teachers. I will describe the process of installing and using the app briefly in the following lines.

Instructions to setup the app:
-
- Clone the repository on your local machine or open the source code zip file with Xcode
- If you want to use it on your personal phone make sure to perpare the device for development mode ( see tutorials on this for more guidance)
- Once the project is setup you can run it by selecting the target model, ideally an Iphone XR since that was used in the development.
- After the project is setup and the application is running, either in the Xcode simulator or on an Iphone, you have complete access to the functionalities of the app.

# Instructions to use the App

For a short demonstration of what the app can/should do, here is a list of steps to follow that will showcase what we want the app to achieve:

- The first screen will be the Schedule screen, here the purpose is for the user to observe the following days of activities. If you click on the "Today's activities" button you will be redirected to another screen that has all of the current day's activities. There is a progress bar that will fill depending on how many of the tasks you complete succcessfully.
- The second screen to access is the transcription one, where you can make use of the speech-to-text feature.
- Next is the Activity screen where you will have a topic, an image that should be related to it, and multiple buttons. If you use the arrows at the top of the screen you can go back and forward through the topics. If you want to see the question on the topic and to answer it, you can click on the "Check" button. If you need help, press the button " Help", and should you want some hints press the button "Hints".
- The "Focus Control" page contains a mini game where the user can regain their focus by changing the background of the page until they have reached the end, which is represented by the progress bar at the top of the screen.
- The last page, the Guidance page, is meant to help the user with transitions from one classroom to another. If you click on the "next" button you will see the next point of interest where you should make a change in direction, and if you press "previous" you will notice how the last location has reappeared on the screen
